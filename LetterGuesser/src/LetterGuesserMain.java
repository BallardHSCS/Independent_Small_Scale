     * In this program the plan is first to generate a random word
     * I was thinking we will have the main method give to the class a random int that will ultimately decide
     * the word selected. This string will be given back to the class and used as the word used for hangman
     * At that point we would already know the number of characters in that string and we would be able to create
     * the characters individually at that point we could compare the users input through the scanner with the characters within the word
     *
     *
     *
     * Note: A way to compound the process of creating the comparable characters is by using a for loop and string length to generate the number of characters and save those characters
     * as it go's through the loop. This will allow us to not write.
     * 1.MAIN:
     * Letterguesser charCompare = null; //This is an initalization
     * if inputScanner.hasNext("quit")
     *  else if(inputScanner.hasnext()){
     *      char input = inputScanner.nextChar;
     *      charCompare = new LetterGuesser(char)
     *
     *  }
     * CLASS:
     * if (randword == 5){
     *      String wordselecter = "Happy"
     *      int charlength = 5
     *
     *     if
     * }
     *
     * 2. We may need two constructors
     *
     * @param args
